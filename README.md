## How to build the project

### Requirements

At the moment of writing, **Node 7.6.0** has been used. 

If you are using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) the project contains an `.nvmrc` file with the version used, just run the following commands:

- `nvm install`
- `nvm use`

Otherwise just install the required version with your preferred method.

### Building the project

- `git clone` the project
- `cd` into the project directory
- `npm install` all the dependencies
- `npm run serve` to start a local server instance, it will open automatically your default browser, if this shouldn't happen, just point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
